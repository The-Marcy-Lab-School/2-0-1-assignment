# 2-0-1-assignment: Intro to CSS

> **TODO: @Instructor -** Fork this repo and update the canvas link for the assignment. Delete this sections before distributing.

## Before you start

For this assignment, we are going to change things up a bit! You'll be practicing your CSS in a game called CSS Diner. You will not need to fork, clone, or do anything with this repo other than follow the instructions.

CSS Diner is an interactive game that will help you practice CSS selectors. You will be challenged to write CSS selectors to select specific elements on a virtual dinner table. As you progress through the levels, you'll learn about various CSS selectors and how they can style elements on a webpage.

## Instructions:

Go to [CSS Diner](https://flukeout.github.io/) and play and complete levels 1 through 20. Once you have completed level 20, take a screenshot/ picture and upload it to the [Canvas assignment](TODO: @Instructor - insert canvas assignment URL).

Happy Coding!
